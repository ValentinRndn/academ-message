        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    Welcome to Imators! These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our services, including our websites, applications, and other offerings (collectively, the "Services"). By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use our Services.

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    At the dawn of a new technological era, Imators is positioning itself as a true pioneer, with the firm ambition of revolutionizing the world of technology. Founded on a forward-looking vision, our mission is to transcend today's boundaries of innovation to design tomorrow's solutions. At Imators, we firmly believe that technology has the power to reshape our daily lives, to provide concrete answers to societal and environmental challenges, and to open the way to hitherto unexplored possibilities.

    Our aim is not just to innovate, but to do so responsibly and sustainably. We are committed to developing technologies that respect the environment, promote inclusion, and guarantee user security and privacy. In this quest for excellence, Imators focuses on artificial intelligence, big data, augmented reality, and blockchain, convinced that these key technologies are driving a revolution that will redefine the way we live, work, and interact.

    <h2>Imators System</h2>
    The Imators System is a long-standing system managed by Imators that allows our various platforms to operate under a single core. This system is activated when information such as legal documents, name, surname, and date of birth are requested.

    In such cases, the system operates using the E.S.P. (Ephemeral Storage Protocol), which consists of saving your data for 5 minutes while the verification, validation, and storage procedures for legal purposes (of name, surname, and IP address) are executed during this time.

    After this period, your data will be marked as "expired," and encryption will render the text unreadable before permanently deleting it to ensure optimal confidentiality and prevent your information from being accessed later in its entirety. A backup protocol, exclusively held by our company, is available to revive the file if a valid justification is present (follow-up procedure, legal proceedings, etc.).

    The Imators System is used on a partner site or other platform when a banner displaying "Powered by Imators System" is shown. This system is robust and ensures the highest level of data protection and efficiency.
